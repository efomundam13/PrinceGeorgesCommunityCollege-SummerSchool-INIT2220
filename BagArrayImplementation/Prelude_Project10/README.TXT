COMMENTARY:
Even though this project asks only for interfaces, we have provided the implementations of the interfaces, as they are needed for Project 11.

The class Wheel implements WheelInterface.
The class WheelCounter implements WheelCounterInterface.
The drivers WheelDriver and WheelCounterDriver demonstrate these classes.
