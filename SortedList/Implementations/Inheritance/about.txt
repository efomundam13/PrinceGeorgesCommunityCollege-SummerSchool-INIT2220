Version 1: SortedList extends LList. See Segment 18.1. Inefficient. Note that we override toArray.

Version 2: LinkedSortedList extends LinkedChainBase. See Segment 18.12. (Same as the solution to Project 1, Chapter 18.)

Version 3: LinkedSortedList extends LinkedChainList, which extends LinkedChainBase. (Same as the solution to Project 2, Chapter 18.)
